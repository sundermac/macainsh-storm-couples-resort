# Couples Resort - FIP 🏝️💖

- Complete **three additional mobile pages** based on the main navigation.
- Create **one desktop page** with original content that is consistent with the existing site.
- Use the **static CSS Grid** for both mobile and desktop layouts.
- Use the **::after pseudo-selector** to add a graphic element on one page.
- Create a simple **CSS animation** for a submit button on one page.
- Implement the **show/hide functionality** using a hamburger menu or the details and summary elements.
